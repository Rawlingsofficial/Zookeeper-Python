# Zookeeper--Python
  programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and user input handling. It allows you to apply these concepts in a fun and interactive way by simulating different animal habitats and allowing the user to view them.  The project also provides a good exercise in structuring your code by using functions to separate different tasks or actions. This can make your code more modular, easier to understand, and reusable.  Additionally, the project encourages problem-solving skills as you need to handle various scenarios, such as handling invalid user input or providing an exit option. It allows you to think about different edge cases and implement appropriate error handling.  Overall, this project is a great way to practice and reinforce your programming skills while having fun with the animal habitat theme. It provides a hands-on experience that allows you to apply what you've learned in a practical context.
